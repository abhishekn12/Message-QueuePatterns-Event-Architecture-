# Message-QueuePatterns-Event-Architecture-

Key Components
1. Event Schema Design:

Base Event class with common properties (event_id, aggregate_id, version, timestamp)
Domain-specific events: OrderCreated, OrderItemAdded, OrderItemRemoved, OrderShipped, OrderCancelled, PaymentProcessed
Events are immutable dataclasses with proper typing

2. Aggregate Root:

AggregateRoot base class with event handling capabilities
Order aggregate that maintains state through event application
Optimistic concurrency control through versioning
Business logic enforcement (e.g., can't modify shipped orders)

3. Event Store:

Append-only event log implementation
Concurrency control with expected version checking
Event retrieval by aggregate ID and timestamp
Snapshot support for performance optimization

4. Projection Builders:

ProjectionBuilder that maintains read models from events
Support for rebuilding and incremental updates
Multiple read models can be registered and updated together

5. Read Models:

OrderSummaryReadModel: Denormalized order summaries for quick queries
InventoryReadModel: Tracks reserved and available inventory
CustomerOrderHistoryReadModel: Customer order history and statistics

Key Features

Event Replay: Complete order state can be reconstructed from events
Optimistic Concurrency: Prevents conflicting updates
Event Serialization: JSON serialization for persistence
Multiple Projections: Different views of the same data
Business Rule Enforcement: Domain logic in the aggregate
Temporal Queries: Query system state at any point in time

Usage Pattern

Create an order aggregate
Apply business operations (create, add items, process payment, ship)
Save to repository (persists events to event store)
Update projections for read models
Query read models for different views of the data

The system demonstrates core event sourcing patterns including event-driven state management, eventual consistency through projections, and separation of write and read models (CQRS). It's designed to be extensible - you can easily add new event types, read models, and business logic while maintaining full audit trails and replay capabilities.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
